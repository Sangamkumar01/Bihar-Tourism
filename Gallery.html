                            transit point for Buddhist <br>pilgrimage centre of Bodhgaya. It is believed that it was
                            here under the tree that Buddha attained enlightenment.<br> Gaya is a busy city situated on
                            the bank of River Phalgu and it is replete with many temples and historic sites dating
                            <br>back to different eras that stand as the evidence to the successful rule of Maurya and
                            Gupta dynasty here. The glory<br> of Gaya was extended so much so that even Hiuen Tsang
                            could not resist mentioning it in his travelogues.

                            Tirthankara, Mahavira spent 14 monsoon seasons here.<br>Even, Buddha is said to have
                            delivered lectures near the mango grove in Nalanda. The fame of this education centre<br>
                            was to an extent that Hieun Tsang, the famous Chinese traveller visited here and stayed for
                            atleast two years here.<br> Even, I-tsing another famous Chinese voyager stayed at Nalanda
                            for about 10 years, AND such was the glory of this place.<br> Today most parts of Nalanda
                            lie in ruins but the place is surely worth exploring!</p> <a

                            amongst the tourists in Bihar. <br>The history of Munger dates back to Aryans, who called

                            name, thus we can expect a large foreign crowd thronging this place. The present day
                            <br>Munger is a twin city, which comprises of Munger and Jamalpur.Reckoned to be one of the
                            oldest cities of Bihar,<br> Munger was once the capital of Mir Kasim before it fell into the
                            hands of British. The place has several historic <br>relics that further add to the charm

                            is believed that Mahavira was born and brought up in 6th century <br>BCE in Kundalagram of
                            Republic of Vaishali. Another major event this place was a witness to was the last sermon of
                            <br>Buddha in 483 BCE. Vaishali was a prosperous kingdom during the time of Buddha, it is
                            also known for its beautiful<br> courtesan Amrapali. So, you see, one has enough to recall
                            in Vaishali and adding to its historic charm is the well-<br>preserved Ashokan Pillar.This
                            ancient city finds mention in the travel accounts of eminent Chinese travellers like<br>
                            Fa-hien and Hieun Tsang.

                            thus this palace remains in ruins now. It is a royal palace and even though it has been

                            Mahavira breathed his last in 500 BCE. It is <br> reckoned to be the cremation ground for
                            this last Tirthankara of Jain sect. The legend has it that, the demand<br> of Lord
                            Mahavira’s ashes was so high that a large amount of soil had to be eroded from around the
                            funeral<br> pyre that a pond was created here. A white marble temple was constructed and it

                            learning. Vikramshila now lies in ruins but<br> renovation work has begun now. During the
                            excavation, Buddhist monasteries, stupas and several wall <br> carvings have been unveiled

                            of the Stupa is dated to the 3rd century <br>BCE.[1] Kesariya Stupa has a circumference of
                            almost 400 feet (120 m) and raises to a height of about 104 feet.<br>The site's exploration
                            reportedly started in the early 19th century, from its discovery led by Colonel<br>
                            Mackenzie in 1814 to General Cunningham's proper excavation in 1861–62. An excavation was
                            conducted <br>by archaeologist KK Muhammed of the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) in
                            1998. The original <br>Kesariya stupa probably dates to the time of Ashoka (circa 250 BCE),
                            as the remains of a capital of a<br> Pillar of Ashoka were discovered there</p> <a
